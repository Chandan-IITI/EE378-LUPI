# LUPI
Course Project for EE378A.
The roadmap is as follows:

## Roadmap
1. Implement SVM
2. Implement SVM+
3. Design LUPI for some other learning algorithm


## TODO (Kedar)
1. Experiment with the code
2. Split the data to x,x*
3. Modify the code to create SVM+ (modify objectives, constraints)
4. Optimize over C, gamma

## TODO (Ahmad)
1. Understand SVM+
2. Think of some othe ML algo to which we want to apply LUPI

## References
1. SVMpy
2. Vapnik's papers
